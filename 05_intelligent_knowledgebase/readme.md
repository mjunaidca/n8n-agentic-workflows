**Zettel #1: Distinction Between Conversational and Agentic AI**
*   **ID:** `202508012338-Distinction-Between-Conversational-And-Agentic-AI`
*   **Note:** The fundamental shift from conversational AI (like the original ChatGPT) to agentic AI is the move from *discussion* to *action*. A conversational AI can generate a script for a YouTube video. An agentic AI system, by contrast, is designed to execute the entire end-to-end workflow: planning the video concept, creating the assets, publishing the final video, marketing it, and analyzing its performance to inform future growth. It doesn't just talk about the task; it performs it.

**Zettel #2: Agentic Reaction and Adaptation Via Feedback Loop**
*   **ID:** `202508012355-Agentic-Reaction-And-Adaptation-Via-Feedback-Loop`
*   **Note:** For an agent to be truly autonomous and effective, it must be able to react and adapt based on the results of its actions. When a task fails (e.g., a published YouTube video "flops"), the system must enter a diagnostic mode. It should analyze the failure across multiple potential causes—the core topic, the content's substance, the video's production quality, the marketing strategy—to inform and improve its next attempt. This creates a crucial feedback loop for continuous improvement.

*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 5)

---
**Zettel #22: Practical Planning Algorithms for LLM Agents**
*   **ID:** `202508020142-Practical-Planning-Algorithms-For-LLM-Agents`
*   **Note:** The most effective planning methods for LLMs are **LLM-Based Planning** (using the LLM's own reasoning to create a plan) and **Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning** (breaking a large task into a hierarchy of smaller sub-tasks).
*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 5)

---
**Zettel #23: Integrating Planning and Tool Use**
*   **ID:** `202508020143-Integrating-Planning-and-Tool-Use`

**Zettel #25: CWD Model Architecture**
*   **ID:** `202508020150-CWD-Model-Architecture`
*   **Note:** The Coordinator, Worker, and Delegator (CWD) model is a hierarchical framework for structuring a MAS. **Coordinator (Manager)** provides strategic oversight. **Worker (Specialist)** executes specific tasks. **Delegator (Dispatcher)** assigns tasks from the Coordinator to the appropriate Worker.
*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 6)

---
**Zettel #26: CWD Agent Role Archetypes**
*   **ID:** `202508020151-CWD-Agent-Role-Archetypes`
*   **Note:** Within the CWD model, agents can be designed with specific archetypes like Manager, Task Interpreter, Analyst, Reflector, and Searcher. In frameworks like CrewAI, this is implemented using a combination of a `role` and `backstory` to shape the agent's system prompt.
*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 6)

---
**Zettel #27: MAS Communication Protocols**
*   **ID:** `202508020152-MAS-Communication-Protocols`

*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 7)

---
**Zettel #30: State Space vs. Environment Model**
*   **ID:** `202508020201-State-Space-vs-Environment-Model`
*   **Note:** An agent needs two models: **1) State Space Representation**, which is the internal, dynamic model of the *current task*, and **2) Environment Model**, which is the model of the *external world* (its rules, APIs, and dynamic conditions).
*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 7)

---
**Zettel #31: Agent Memory Architectures**
*   **ID:** `202508020202-Agent-Memory-Architectures`
*   **Note:** A layered memory system is crucial for coherence. **Short-Term (Working) Memory** for the current task. **Long-Term (Knowledge Base) Memory** for persistent facts and profiles. **Episodic Memory** for storing records of past interactions to learn from specific experiences.
*   **Reference:** (Building Agentic AI Systems, Chapter 7)

---
